<!-- Must do -->
- Convert phone number to correct format


<!-- Updates -->
- Possibly remove padding from class 'card' for card divs. This will allow for clicking of full box, instead of cutting off part of the box.


<!-- Questions -->
- Is there an easier way to construct the classes, rather than manually?
